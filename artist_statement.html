    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <br>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio, I’m Alicia Chi. I’m currently attending SJSU majoring in Studio Art Practice. </p>
    <br>
      <p>     I'm an interdisciplinary artist who works primarily with digital media. I’m always willing to explore, learn, and grow to incorporate new skill sets into my creative process.</p>
     <br>
      <p>Salvador Dali once said, "A true artist is not one who is inspired, but one who inspires others." This quote resonates with my artistic vision as an artist.</p>
      <br>
      <p>     As a child, I was heavily influenced by Japanese comics, animations, and games. I’ve always wanted to become an illustrator and a storyteller by crafting narratives and stories encompassing my love for action and adventure. This has been the principle of my creative process; to build a narrative that inspires others to discuss, think, or even act.</p>
      <br>
      <p>     Digital media has been the center of my work. Computers have been a significant part of my life, being introduced when I was 6 years old. As I grew older, I was able to invest in and explore technology as a medium to create art. Starting with my mouse and laptop, I delved into the realm of digital art and illustration, exploring and learning different programs and tools to better convey my art to the world. As I settled with digital illustration, different forms of media began piquing my interest. 3D modeling, coding, and videogame design are just a few to name, and exploring these other mediums persuade me to venture into the unknown territories they have to offer. Primarily learning through self-teaching and my own online research, I have become aware of the nuances such as composition, deliberate strokes, and the importance of conceptualizing to express my ideas better. Taking classes here at SJSU has expanded and opened opportunities for me to craft and explore more interactive experiences for the audience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>     Most of my current work is centered around sharing alternative perspectives of the world. My Net art, visual novel, and glitch art are some examples of a view from an alternate perspective the viewer may have. Let them be my own experiences or mere exaggerated reflections of the current world, I want to use my work to craft experiences for the viewer and allow the audience to feel and interpret my work in their own way. </p>
    <br>
      <p>     I believe that art is much like language. It has the ability to relay its message to a greater and more vast audience. The aim of my projects is to move towards creating interactive experiences, where the viewer is invited to engage with the artwork in a more immersive way. These experiences can take many forms, from website installations to user interaction. However, my underlying goal is always to create an engaging and thought-provoking experience that encourages viewers to think critically about the world around them.  </p>
    <br>
      <p>     In the future, I would like to familiarize myself with 3D modeling and incorporate it into my workflow to better craft immersive and interactive experiences. I would like to eventually work with virtual reality as a medium and explore how that can be used to convey my work.</p>
